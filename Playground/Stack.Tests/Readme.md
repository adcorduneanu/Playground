Stack
=========

Rules

All the following rules must be satisfied:
- When the stack is empty you can't pop - an exception must be raised
- You are restricted to only 2 operations
    - object Pop() - should return the last insterted element
    - void Push(object item) - should store the given element
- You need to preserve the items order during the mutations 

Extra
- Ensure that the `Stack` implementation is thread safe
